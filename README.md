## 📸 Screenshots

### Skill Editor Panel
The main interface features a sidebar with your skill list and a full-width editor area. Now featuring a universal **@ icon system** for clean selection.

### Adaptive Responsiveness
The UI intelligently adapts to window resizing. Button labels automatically collapse into icons when space is tight, and the path detail folds away to prioritize readability.

### Language Switcher
A globe icon in the sidebar footer lets you switch between 16 supported languages instantly.

### 💡 How to Open the Editor
There are **3 easy ways** to launch the Ultra Skills Editor:

## 📁 How Skills Are Stored

Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
~/.antigravity/skills/          ← Global skills (available in all projects)
├── code-reviewer/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── test-writer/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── api-designer/
    └── SKILL.md

<your-project>/cursor_skills/   ← Project skills (only for this project)
├── project-helper/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── deploy-guide/
    └── SKILL.md
```

- **Global Skills** are stored in `~/.antigravity/skills/` and are accessible from any project.
- **Project Skills** are stored inside your workspace (e.g. `cursor_skills/`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/skills/`) and stay with the project.

## 📖 Feature Details

### Creating Skills
Click the **+** button in the sidebar header. A modal dialog will appear where you can:
- Enter a name for your skill
- Choose whether to save it as **Global** (available everywhere) or **Project** (local to the current workspace)

### Editing Skills
Click any skill in the sidebar to open it in the editor. The content is displayed in a monospace editor optimized for markdown. Press **Ctrl/Cmd + S** to quick-save, or click the **Save** button in the toolbar.

### Using the @ Icon Cart (Selection)
- **Direct Selection**: Click the `@` icon next to any skill in the sidebar to toggle its selection state. Selected skills turn blue.
- **Range Selection**: Hold the **Shift** key while clicking the `@` icons to select or deselect a range of skills instantly.
- **Clipboard Sync**: Your selection is automatically synced to the system clipboard as a list of Markdown links. Simply press `Cmd/Ctrl + V` in your chat to use them!

### Importing Skills
Click the **Import** button (archive icon) in the sidebar header. You can select:
- **Individual `.md` files** — they will be automatically wrapped into a proper skill folder with `SKILL.md`
- **Entire folders** — they will be copied as-is into your skills directory

After selecting files, you'll be prompted to choose the destination (Global or Project).

### Deleting Skills
Click the **red trash icon** in the editor toolbar. A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental deletion. This action permanently removes the skill folder and its contents.

### Switching Languages
